I'm a Computer Engineering graduate from the State University of Maranhão with hands-on experience in Web Development and Database Administration.  
I work primarily with <strong>Python, Django, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript</strong>.  

I’m an active member of my local Python community and enjoy attending tech events to learn and grow.  
My philosophy is simple: I’m always open to change and eager to learn more.  

Currently, I’m studying Data Science with Python and looking forward to deepening my knowledge to work more effectively with Oracle databases.  

Outside of tech, I enjoy music, sports, reading, and traveling. 🎶⚽📚✈️
